= History behind =

Sessionweb is a tool that has its origin at Securitas Direct in Sweden. It was developed as an internal test tool to support the session based test management that is used.
When the tool was up and running I asked if we could publish this tool as open source to give something back to the community since Securitas Direct is using a wide variety of open source tools.
